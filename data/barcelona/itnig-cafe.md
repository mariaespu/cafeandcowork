review:
  en: This coffee shop is managed by Syra coffee, a popular chain of coffee shops in Spain. The building is a coworking space/startup community called itnig, which you can book from one day to as long as you need. The cafeteria is open to the public with plenty of seating. WiFi works well. Also, there is plenty of comfortable seating to sit in throughout the day, especially if you are alone. There are power outlets so you can charge your computer. During the central hours of the day there is very good light.
